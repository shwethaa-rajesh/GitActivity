### Question 1

1. What is a VCS and why is it needed?

> VCS is version control system. VCS is used to make sure that the files in our local repository are upto date with that of the remote repository. In a team, it makes sure that there is no conflict between the code. It helps keep track of all changes made and revert to the previous versions


2. Whats is the difference between a forked repo and a cloned repo?

> Forked Repo | Cloned Repo 
  ---  |  --- 
  Forked repo creates a copy of the original repository into your github remote repo | Cloned repo clones the content of the remote repository to the local repository


3. Why do we create branches?

> Branches can be used when each person in a team has a different feature to work on. Each branch can implement a particular module/feature and a pull request can be sent to the main branch before merging

4. What is the use of fork if we can create branches?

> A branch cannot be created unless you are a collaborator. Branches are used to work on a particular feature while using a fork duplicates the whole project to the remote repository
